		<h1>1. Wheelchair for disabilities peoples</h1>

		<p>
The wheelchair is one of the most commonly used assistive devices to promote mobility and enhance quality of life for people who have difficulties in walking 
(e.g. a person with spinal cord injuries resulting in quadriplegia or paraplegia, muscular dystrophy,etc).
It is safe to say that accessibility benefits all members of society including people with disabilities. 
Wheelchair services provide the framework for assessing individual user needs. That is why LORE provide wheelchair.</p>

		<p>
A reading space can help build literacy skills such as sentence structure, punctuation and grammar. This is because, when books are readily available to use, 
students may be more likely to pick them up and read them, 
which is fantastic for developing important skills in reading and writing. This is a place where children can go to find books they're interested in and where
they feel comfortable and welcomed. A reading corner can also help to build confidence, develop literacy skills,
and promote a positive learning community.</p>

		<p>
Copy machines can be used in several ways in the library and one of the most important is to make copies of other documents. The chances of having more copies of a particular document in a library are very high.
A student can make more copies of a document or the library attendant might need more copies for documentation and the copy machine cannot be overlooked.
Also, copy machines in LORE come in different styles. Some can make copies in black and white, while some make copies in coloured form.
The good thing about these copy machines is that they can make more copies is just a matter of seconds and not tamper with the document quality.
As we continue to advance and experience innovations, there are copy machines that do not only make copies, but do another vital paper-related task.
There are copy machines that can also serve as a scanner and fax machine. Also, with some copy machines, library users can get print documents from their mail or mobile phones. 
The paperwork needs which copy machines can meet especially in a library is plenty, and hence they cannot be overlooked.
Here are common types of Copy machines that can be used in our library. Mono copiers Color copiers

Network Copiers

Multifunctional Copiers

Desktop Copiers.</p>



		<h1>4. Multipurpose room</h1>

		<img src="room3.jpg" width="600" height="300"><br>

		<p>
In libraries where multi-purpose rooms are made available, the primary function of these rooms is to provide space for library-related activities. Such activities as story hours, film programs, 
discussion groups, and other activities sponsored or co-sponsored by  library but we will  will receive priority for booking. Our Multipurpose room also  can be used for multipurpose activities such as meetings, 
instructional activities and social gatherings.</p>

Computers are used in libraries all over the world to provide access to a range of electronic information resources and to manage materials 
(books, journals, videos, and other media) held in particular collections. Digitization makes the invisable to be 
visible. Several users can access the same material the same time wihout hindrance. Computers are used in Libraries to provide access to a range 
of electronic information resources and to manage materials(books, journals, videos, and other media held in our particular collections. 
So they can access our material either onlne or copy material.</p>
